Dalmais Font

Hi, thanks for downloading my font Dalmais and I hope you like it. Remember: it's free for personal and commercial use! Hey, like me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Skomii.PauloR   to know more about me and what I'm doing.

PS: I'm dedicating this font for Amy Winehouse to show my LOVE for her and for the awesome "PERSON" she was and still is for me! With this font I also want to say THANK YOU for all the good songs she SUNG and WROTE. And for her beauty. Even if she is gone now...

The font Dalmais was designed by Paulo R in 2013.
